### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



### Daniele Polotow - [Data Scientist] ðŸ‘‹

### I am an biologist/researcher transitioning to Data Science. Wannabe programmer. Using statistics and code to understand the world. 17 years of experience with scientific research in Brazil and abroad. I love leveraging data-driven solutions that impact business and society!

- ðŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m currently studing and working in projects to improve my Data Science skills
- ðŸ“Š Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other Data Scientists and developers

## Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Coded in Python and presented as Jupyter Notebooks.

Languages: English and Portuguese.

- ### Machine Learning
  - [Spider Image Classification with TensorFlow](https://github.com/danielepolotow/spider_image/blob/main/Spider%20Image%20Classification%20Project.ipynb): Using supervised algorithm with Keras and TensorFlow. This is an ongoing project that uses deep learning to identify SEM (scanning electron microscope) images of spiders. The images are divided in 6 categories (chelicerae, eyes, legs, palp, spinnerets, and trichobothia), which are used to describe important features in spider morphology. As an ongoing project, the images used will not be public in this repository.

  - [Clustering the Big 5 Personalities](https://github.com/danielepolotow/Big5/blob/main/5%20Big%20-%20K-Means.ipynb): In this notebook I present a model with K-Means Clustering using Python and Scikit-learn to classify test responses in groups. K-Means is an algorithm with unsupervised learning, which will group responses by similarity. The results allow us to make predictions and classify new data. Last, I created an interface to interact with users and get the answers to the test and the predictions from the model.

- ### Data Visualization and Exploration
  - [The famous Titanic Dataset](https://github.com/danielepolotow/titanic/blob/main/Titanic%20an%C3%A1lise%20explorat%C3%B3ria%20de%20dados.ipynb): In this notebook, we will analyze the famous Titanic data set, available on Kaggle. The dataset is intended for supervised machine learning, but we'll just do some exploratory analysis here.
  - [NBA data with nba_api](https://github.com/danielepolotow/NBA/blob/main/Dados%20NBA%20-%20m%C3%B3dulo%20nba_api%20com%20Python.ipynb): Basic steps to access data in this huge API.
